# AGENTS.md

`agents/` is this repository's only content source: everything else — the generated agent files, the backend assets, the installed targets — is assembled from it. Validation is `node bin/my-workbench.js assemble --check` (which also renders the DSH composition and lane plugin, and loads the settings page's inert host half) plus, for CLI changes, running the CLI. There is no build and no test suite. Keep this file structural and lean: record where things live and what may not change, not how a mechanism works.

## Targets

| Target | Flag | Where it installs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| opencode (native) | default set | `.opencode/` — core config plus native `.opencode/agents/*.md` |
| claude | default set | `.claude/` — `settings.json` plus `.claude/agents/*.md`; omos-agnostic, identical in every target |
| omos | `--omos` | `.opencode/` project assets only; exclusive with `--opencode` |
| user level | `--user` | the same opencode/omos + claude assets under `~/.config/opencode/` + `~/.claude/` |
| zcode | `--zcode` | `~/.zcode/AGENTS.md` (the orchestrator prompt as ZCode's global instruction file) + `~/.zcode/agents/*.md` |
| dsh | `--dsh` | `<DSH_HOME>/.agent-presets/my-workbench/` (`DSH_HOME`, else `~/.dsh`); requires an existing DSH home |

Every target downloads nothing and writes nothing inside a project; existing files are skipped unless `--force`.

**opencode** requires an `opencode` binary on PATH. When a user-level omos install is detected, it installs the omos way instead (omits assets, no native agents) to avoid agent conflicts.

**omos** requires OpenCode **and** a pre-existing user-level omos install in `~/.config/opencode`: the plugin loads from that user level, so my-workbench never pins a `"plugin"` entry. Its `orchestrator_append.md` restates the universal Disciplines for the plugin-provided omos orchestrator prompt.

**zcode** has no configurable main agent and no project-level subagents, so `~/.zcode/` is the whole install.

**dsh** needs one deliberate exception, because the tools and the settings page mount at different levels: the preset owns the seven `subagent_*` tools and the `my-workbench-lanes` settings namespace (seeded from a recommended model mapping), while the page can only be served from a profile row — client halves are discovered on the profile loader's entries, never inside a preset. `--dsh` therefore also maintains ONE marked, managed block in `<DSH_HOME>/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml` holding one inert row, skipped with a printed row when no single profile directory can be found. `agents/backends/dsh/` and `docs/dsh-lane-plugin/` carry the details.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/my-workbench.js` | The CLI (zero dependencies, ESM). |
| `agents/prompts/` | Agent prompt bodies — the single source, each opening with the omos attribution notice. |
| `agents/prompts_cn/` | Chinese reference translations of the prompt bodies — never packaged. |
| `agents/backends/<name>/` | Everything backend-specific: the assets copied to a target, plus `agents.json` (frontmatter per agent, markdown backends) and `slots/` for `{{slot:...}}` text. `dsh/` is template-only — no `agents.json`: `agent.cordis.yml` lists the rows and pulls prompt bodies with `{{prompt:<agent>}}`, `lane-plugin/` is the packaged host half the preset mounts, `lane-plugin-ui/` the settings page the profile mounts. |
| `docs/` | Reference only, never shipped: the DSH lane plugin's design record (`docs/dsh-lane-plugin/`) and the agent-skill notes (`docs/agents/`). |
| `.claude/`, `.opencode/` | This repo's own live agent setup — generated, gitignored; materialize with `npx my-workbench assemble`. |
| `package.json` | npm package **`my-workbench`**; the `files` whitelist is the tarball contract. |

`.opencode/node_modules/` and `.opencode/package-lock.json` are installed runtime artifacts — never committed or packaged. A fresh clone materializes `.claude/` and `.opencode/` with `npx my-workbench assemble`.

## Single source & generated files

| Source (edit here) | Generated (do not hand-edit) |
| --- | --- |
| `agents/backends/claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json` |
| `agents/backends/opencode/opencode.jsonc` | `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` |
| `agents/backends/omos/oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` | `.opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` |
| `agents/backends/omos/oh-my-opencode-slim/` | `.opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/` |
| `agents/backends/omos/package.json` | `.opencode/package.json` |
| `agents/disciplines.md` + `agents/prompts/*.md` + `agents/backends/*/agents.json` + `agents/backends/*/slots/*.md` | `.claude/agents/*.md`, target `.opencode/agents/*.md` |
| `agents/backends/zcode/`, `agents/backends/dsh/` | user-level only, nothing generated inside this repo: `~/.zcode/` and `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/my-workbench/` |

Run `npx my-workbench assemble` in the repo root after editing any source (`--check` verifies without writing).

## Commits

One sentence saying what changed, and nothing else. Subject on one line, each body paragraph on one line, never a hard-wrapped body.

## Editing conventions

- **Agent prompts / roster** → edit `agents/prompts/*.md`; in the same change update the matching `agents/prompts_cn/<agent>_cn.md` and keep frontmatter in `agents/backends/*/agents.json` in sync; then assemble. Keep the omos attribution notice that opens each adapted body verbatim and first: `stripAttribution()` drops it from every generated prompt by exact match, so an edited or moved notice ships into the delivered text. `agents/prompts/improver.md` is in-house and deliberately carries none — do not add one.
- **Backend-specific text** → `{{slot:<name>}}` in `agents/prompts/*.md`, filled from `agents/backends/<name>/slots/<name>.md`. A slot referenced by any prompt must exist for every backend or assembly fails.
- **Universal behavior rules** → `agents/disciplines.md` is the single authored copy, with `agents/disciplines_cn.md` beside it. Assembly appends the English file to every delivered agent prompt — markdown backends, DSH preset persona and DSH lane personas — so no delegation brief repeats it. One rule per concern.
- **DSH preset composition** → `agents/backends/dsh/agent.cordis.yml` is the template: the orchestrator persona plus ONE row (`- id: lanes`) naming the lane plugin with a `./`-relative `name`. A `{{prompt:<agent>}}` placeholder must stand alone on its own line.
- **DSH lane plugin (host half)** → `agents/backends/dsh/lane-plugin/`. The roster, the per-lane `toolFilter` deny lists and the recommended model mapping live in `host-package/src/index.js`; prompts are not duplicated — `prompts.template.js` pulls them into `src/prompts.generated.js`. Adding a specialist means its roster entry, its prompt placeholder, its row in the settings page, and its `toolName` in every other lane's deny list (a lane stays a leaf; `tools.restrict()` rejects unknown names, so a stale list fails loudly at spawn). `assemble --check` proves the three lane tables agree; reinstall with `npx my-workbench --dsh`.
- **DSH lane settings page** → `agents/backends/dsh/lane-plugin-ui/`, mounted by a profile row, NOT by the preset. `src/index.js` stays inert — no tools, no services, no settings namespace — and `lib/client.js` uses only the shipped Remote wire (`ctx.remote.settings.describe()/update()`, `ctx.remote.session.modelCatalog()`), never a package-private RPC. Its registration stays SYNCHRONOUS in `apply()`. The CLI owns the profile row (`writeLaneUiPatchRow`); do not hand-edit the installed `cordis.patch.yml`. Rationale for each of these sits in `docs/dsh-lane-plugin/` and the package's own `README.md`.
- **Bare imports in the lane plugin are forbidden** except through a `{{dep:<alias>}}` placeholder declared in `DSH_LANE_PLUGIN_DEPS` (`bin/my-workbench.js`), which `--dsh` bakes into an absolute `file:` URL at install time — a plugin under `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/` cannot resolve a package by name. The settings page declares no dependencies, and its browser half may only `require` the shell's nine seed modules; `assemble --check` enforces both plus the `dsh.client`/`exports["./client"]` pair DSH scans for.
- **Model / variant / council presets** → `agents/backends/omos/oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc`. Keep JSONC parseable (comments and trailing commas allowed).
- **Prompt tuning** → append-only, via `agents/backends/omos/oh-my-opencode-slim/<agent>_append.md` (`orchestrator_append.md` is the working example). A full `<agent>.md` replacement must restate the entire bundled prompt and is a last resort.
- **Terminology**: in prose and docs, call the plugin **omos**; keep the full name `oh-my-opencode-slim` in paths and filenames.
- **No downloads**: my-workbench never pins a `"plugin"` entry and never downloads or executes anything. The omos target only copies project assets and requires a pre-existing user-level omos install; never widen it silently.

## Target projects

After `npx my-workbench`, the target owns the same tree: edit its `agents/` source and run `npx my-workbench assemble` there; `assemble --check` detects drift. Retune the model mapping to the providers and budget available in the target, and replace this root file with the target project's own instructions.
